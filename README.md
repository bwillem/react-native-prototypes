# react-native-prototypes ðŸ“±
prototyping as part of the [technical design document](https://docs.google.com/a/freshgrade.com/document/d/11UCUE8rAa13-dk36CjuO52TZGPilFPhe_9QxNQfJFQI/edit?usp=sharing) for a cross-platform teacher mobile experience.

### Project blueprint
#### Building
* [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) => state management.
* [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) => standard react bindings for redux.
* [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) => nice routing and nav library and uses `NavigationExperimental` component.
* [react-native-elements](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-elements) => ui kit used for the sake of rapid prototyping.
#### Testing
* [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) => utility to render and manipulate components
* chai => assertion library
* [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react-native.html) => snapshot testing

# The add students module

## Navigation
This uses [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux), a router library that plays nice with redux and uses the React Native Nagivator component.

## Component example
Let's break this component down a bit
``` JavaScript
// ES6 module imports from npm modules
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { FormInput, FormLabel, Button } from 'react-native-elements';

class AddStudent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ paddingTop: 40 }}>
        <FormLabel>Firstname</FormLabel>
        <FormInput
          value={this.props.firstname}
          // Firing studentUpdate action on user input event
          onChangeText={text => this.props.studentUpdate({prop: 'firstname', value: text})}
        />
        <FormLabel>Lastname</FormLabel>
        <FormInput
          value={this.props.lastname}
          // Firing studentUpdate action on user input event
          onChangeText={text => this.props.studentUpdate({prop: 'lastname', value: text})}
        />
        <Button
          small
          backgroundColor='#03A9F4'
          buttonStyle={{borderRadius: 0, marginTop: 20}}
          title='SAVE STUDENT'
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
};
```
First we create a new class called AddStudent, which extends React's Component class. Class-based components must have a render method, which returns JSX elements to be parsed into HTML and rendered into the DOM. Some of these JSX elements are part of the react-native library, some are part of a ui kit I'm using. `<View>` is a ubiquitous react-native component, while `FormLabel`, `FormInput`, and `Button` are pre-styled components provided by `react-native-elements` library. When we move forward with a production app, we'll likely make our own group of pre-style components like this, to be reused throughout the app.
So JSX elements are representations of components. For example, we could import and use `AddStudent` in any other component. Components are passed various props of different data types, some expect objects, some expect functions, etc, depending on the component signature. The `style` prop expects an object of css rules.

## Controlled components
Let's pull this out from the JSX and take a closer look:
```
<FormInput
  value={this.props.firstname}
  // Firing studentUpdate action on user input event
  onChangeText={text => this.props.studentUpdate({prop: 'firstname', value: text})}
/>
```
This is what's happening:
User Input -> Fires action creator, `studentUpdate` -> Action creator sends an object to a reducer -> Reducer ingests the action and returns new state -> new state is set as the form value.

So the text appearing in the input is actually a piece of state, being actively set as a user types. This is a good conceptual pattern for 2-way binding. Everything a user does is ingested by an action, then a reducer, and state is returned to the components.
